"""Lightweight Python stubs for Jito protocol buffers.

This repository originally expects the gRPC protocol buffers from the
`mev-protos` submodule. The minimal stubs defined here allow scripts in this
repository to run in environments where the protobuf definitions are not
available.  They do **not** implement the actual network protocol and should be
replaced with real generated modules when the submodule is present.
